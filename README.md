# Gift for DRON12261 [Community Project, 18 maps]

A little preface from me. I didn't take any part in the development of this project and didn't know about it until day of release, when this megawad was sent to me in a private message and I was called to stream it in discord. It's not JokeWad. Despite the fact that the idea of the project revolved around a single meme, this is a full-fledged megawad from the community with 17+1 maps, with very diverse and elaborate maps that can surprise you a lot. Thank you very much to all the mappers and those who were still somehow directly or indirectly involved, it was awesome.
